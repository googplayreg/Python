# The if statement evaluates a condition (an expression that results in True or False). 
# If the condition is true, the code block inside the if statement is executed. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

# Checking if a number is positive:
number = 15
if number > 0:
  print("The number is positive")

# Boolean variables can be used directly in if statements without comparison operators:
is_logged_in = True
if is_logged_in:
  print("Welcome back!")
